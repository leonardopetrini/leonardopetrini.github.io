Salut! Je suis Léo. I'm an Italian expat in Switzerland. My typical thing is to bring grampas' [ciauscolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciauscolo) from [Le Marche :house_with_garden:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marche) to 
make a _panino_ with [gruyère 🧀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8re_cheese) and go hike the Alps 🌄. 

Most of my time I spend as a PhD student of *deep learning theory* at the [Physics of complex systems lab, EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/pcsl/), advised by Matthieu Wyart. 
I'm a [*machine learning experimentalist*](https://ml-eval.github.io/assets/pdf/science_ml_proposal_2am.pdf), my focus is in the rigorous study of existing deep neural networks to discover fundamental recurring
laws that deepen our understanding of their _unreasonable_ effectiveness. When deep nets get too complicated I resort to [*toy models* 🐮](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) 
that reproduce the observed phenomena and allow for quantitative understanding.

A more serious summary of my research can be found in the publications tab.
